# Elections-Using-Blockchain

Using the Solitidy language we "create" a system that will define contracts and parties that will be assigned to a blockchain.

The above contracts have been created with specifications that in case we ask for opinions of sensitive content, 
the security, the protection of personal data, the requirements of the poll, the integrity of the results must be ensured.

This example concerns an electoral process.
